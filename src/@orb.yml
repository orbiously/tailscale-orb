  Connect the build-host to your Tailnet and establish a link with another Tailscale host.
  You can then use that remote Tailscale host as a bastion/jump host.
  This is an “executor-agnostic” orb; the commands work regrdless of the job's executor.
  All executors (Docker,  Linux `machine`, macOS, and Windows) are supported.
